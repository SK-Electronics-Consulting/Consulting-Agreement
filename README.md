# Consulting Agreement

## Background
This is meant to be a consulting agreement template to quickly generate a consulting agreement PDF, which can be submitted to HelloSign/Docusign/etc. for signatures.

It is written in Linux, and is based off a consulting agreement found online.  (TODO: find source link.)

The intention is to make a clean agreement document that hides all the checkboxes and options, and strictly keeps the applicable clauses.  It also formats things nicely without requiring much post-processing.
